%% University of Guelph Thesis Template
%%
%% This template outlines the structure of a thesis conforming to the 
%% University of Guelph thesis style guidelines, using the included thesis 
%% class.  The file has been verbosely commented to make it as 
%% self-explanatory as possible.  Additional documentation for the options and
%% commands for the thesis class is included in the README.txt and in the 
%% comments in the class file.
%%
%% For brevity and simplicity, this template assumes that you will structure 
%% your thesis by placing each element (individual chapters, abstract, 
%% acknowledgements, etc.) into its own file and including it here.  All of 
%% the components of a thesis (required and optional) have been listed here 
%% in the proper order.  Optional components have been commented out.  You 
%% need to replace the text contained in angle brackets with values 
%% appropriate to your thesis and otherwise modify this file to suit your 
%% needs (including possibly removing these comments).
%%

%% <options>:  Leave blank for the defaults (10pt, single spaced, wide 
%%             margins).  Specify 12pt if you want to be nice to your 
%%             reader/committee, and add traditional, double if you want the 
%%             19th century look.  For final submission specify final to hide 
%%             the hyperlinks (required by grad studies)
